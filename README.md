Sylar is a framework-agnostic open source `Intrusion Detection System`.

The idea behind this project is as simple as the fingerprint Touch ID technology. It offers a convenient and drop-in solution for the ones that otherwise would not have any security precaution installed.
While an IDS bundled with the application will never compete with one that acts on the network, Sylar aims for ease of use and it succeeds in providing the most security given the low resources it uses (taking both time and computing power in consideration).

### Installation
